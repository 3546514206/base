September 09, 2022 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a new
major release of our open source framework for the development of native
cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.2.1 is part of the API and ABI-stable 3.2.x release series and is
now available from

    https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

and

    https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/v3.2.1

Coming soon after 3.2.0, this is mostly a bug fix release, with just one
noteworthy new feature: the addition of wxFileDialog::AddShortcut() function.
However it fixes some important regressions and other problems:

- Fix crash in applications calling g_log_set_writer_func() with recent glib.
- Several fixes to alpha channel handling in wxMSW bitmaps.
- Generate key and focus events for wxSearchCtrl in wxOSX.
- Fix creating wxRadioBox without any items in wxOSX.
- Fix regression with AUI floating pane positioning.
- Avoid new warnings given by gcc 12.
- Fix building with MSVS 2022 standard-conforming preprocessor.
- Work around MSVS 2022 optimizer bug that broke wxImage resizing.
- NetBSD build fixes.

Please see the full change log for more details:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.2.1/docs/changes.txt

This release is API and ABI-compatible with 3.2.0, so the existing
applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the fixes
above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.

We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
