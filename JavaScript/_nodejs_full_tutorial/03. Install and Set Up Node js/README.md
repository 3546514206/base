### ‚ö° Verifying the Installation

To verify that Node.js is installed on your computer, open a terminal or command prompt and type `node -v`. This should
display the version of Node.js that you have installed.

### ‚ö° Updating Node.js

To update Node.js to the latest version, you can either download the latest installer from the Node.js website and run
it or use a package manager to update it.

#### üìÉ Using the Installer

-
    1. Visit the official Node.js website [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the latest `.msi` file
       according to your system environment (32-bit or 64-bit).
-
    2. Run the Node.js setup wizard by double-clicking on the downloaded `.msi` file.
-
    3. Follow the same steps as when installing Node.js for the first time.

#### üìÉ Using a Package Manager

Open a terminal or command prompt and type in the command to update Node.js using your package manager of choice. For
example, for Windows using Chocolatey, you can type `choco upgrade nodejs`.

> Note: The command to update Node.js may vary depending on your package manager. Refer to its documentation for more details.

### ‚ö° Running a Node.js Program

To run a Node.js program, you need to create a file with the `.js` extension and write some JavaScript code in it.

-
    1. Open a text editor such as Notepad or Visual Studio Code.
-
    2. Type in some JavaScript code such as `console.log('Hello, world!')`.
-
    3. Save the file with a `.js` extension such as `hello.js`.
-
    4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `hello.js` is located using `cd` command.
-
    5. Type `node hello.js` and press Enter.

This should print `Hello, world!` to the terminal or command prompt.
