### As a Local Project

You'll want to start by installing dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Since this is a CLI, you'll probably want to get it available on your PATH. There's two ways you can do this:

**Via global installation:**

```bash
npm i -g # this will install the current working directory as a global module.
fake-names-generator # run the CLI
```

You may want to run `npm uninstall -g` from the project directory to uninstall it.

**Via symlink:**

```bash
npm link # this will create a symlink that makes the module act as a global module.
fake-names-generator # run the CLI
```

`npm unlink` to remove this.

### As a Module Published to npm

If you were to pulbish this CLI to npm, there'd be two ways you'd use it from the registry with npm (let's assume you
published as `fake-names-generator`):

```bash
npm i -g fake-names-generator # Install the module from the registry & make it globally available

fake-names-generator # run the CLI
```

```bash
npx fake-names-generator # this would temporarily download the module, run the first entry in `bin` of package.json and pass along any additional arguments like `--save`
```

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```
