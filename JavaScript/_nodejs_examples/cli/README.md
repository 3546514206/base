# Node.js Examples: CLI

In this directory, we have examples of Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) built with Node.js. See
the [Examples section](../README.md#examples) of the root [README.md](../README.md) for a list of all projects contained
within, or take a look through the directories yourself.

## What is a CLI in the context of nodejs/examples

Anything that can be considered a command-line interface, built with Node.js.

## Contributing to Examples

If you're interested in seeing more examples of CLIs or want to help maintain the current examples, we more than welcome
your contribution! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details ðŸ¤—
