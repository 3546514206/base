# Node.js Examples: Applications

In this directory, we have examples of Applications that are built with or extensively leverage Node.js. See
the [Examples section](../README.md#examples) of the root [README.md](../README.md) for a list of all projects contained
within, or take a look through the directories yourself.

## What is an Application in the context of nodejs/examples

Anything that can be considered a standalone application. For example:

- Desktop applications that bundle or otherwise use Node.js
- Mobile applications that leverage Node.js
- Other bundled applications that can be run as a standalone executable

## Contributing to Examples

If you're interested in seeing more examples of applications or want to help maintain the current examples, we more than
welcome your contribution! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details ðŸ¤—
