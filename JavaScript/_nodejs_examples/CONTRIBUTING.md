# Contributing

We genuinely appreciate folks who are trying to help out by lowering the barrier to understanding Node.js ðŸ¤—

Our baseline for all contributions is following the project's [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing New Examples

If you'd like to contribute an example, we'd genuinely appreciate your help. There's a few things we'll expect from any
contribution of a new example:

- New examples should **probably** fit within the existing categories.
    - If there's an example you'd like to make that _doesn't_ fit into a category, please don't hesitate to create an
      issue to suggest a broad category that it _would_ fit within.
- Usable example code. This means:
    - Comprehensive comments.
    - Descriptive and readable variable names.
    - Modern JavaScript.
- Jest for testing. Examples' tests should check these boxes:
    - Tests should be written for all code that can be tested.
    - Tests should be in the format of `<name-of-file-being-tested>.test.js` and should live alongside the files they're
      testing.
- Proper documentation. This means:
    - A README.md that explains what the example does and how to use it, plus documents the examples dependencies.
    - The README should include a title, description, instructions for usage, and instructions for running the test.

## Contributing to Tests

We're always willing to take on more tests or improvements to our existing tests. We use Jest as our test tooling at
present.

## Contributing to Prose

This repository has a non-trivial amount of written content. If you're interested in helping provide clarity and context
or otherwise improving our prose, we welcome your contributions.
