## The Star Spangled Banner

Oh, say can you {verb} by the dawn's early {noun}
What so {adverb} we {past tense verb} at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad {plural noun} and bright {plural noun} through the {adjective} fight,
O'er the {plural noun} we watched were so gallantly {verb ending in -ing}?
And the rocket's {color} glare, the {plural noun} bursting in {noun},
Gave proof through the night that our {noun} was still there.
Oh, say does that {adjective} banner yet {verb}
O'er the land of the {adjective} and the home of the {adjective}?

I immediately think about the  {plural noun} inside it. I think about how they 
{verb} to create programs and how many {plural noun} will be generated.
