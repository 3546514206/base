Description :
Newton's second law of motion pertains to the behavior of objects for which
all existing forces are not balanced.
The second law states that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables
- the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object.
The acceleration of an object depends directly
upon the net force acting upon the object,
and inversely upon the mass of the object.
As the force acting upon an object is increased,
the acceleration of the object is increased.
As the mass of an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is decreased.
