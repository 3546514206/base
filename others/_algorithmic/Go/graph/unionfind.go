// Union Find Algorithm or Dynamic Connectivity algorithm, often implemented with the help
//of the union find data structure,
// is used to efficiently maintain connected components in a graph that undergoes dynamic changes,
// such as edges being added or removed over time
// Worst Case Time Complexity: The time complexity of find operation is nearly constant or
//O(α(n)), where where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function
// practically, this is a very slowly growing function making the time complexity for find
//operation nearly constant.
// The time complexity of the union operation is also nearly constant or O(α(n))
// Worst Case Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes or element in the structure
