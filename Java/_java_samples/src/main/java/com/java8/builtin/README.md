The JDK 1.8 API contains many built-in functional interfaces.
Some of them are well known from older versions of Java like Comparator or Runnable.
Those existing interfaces are extended to enable Lambda support via the @FunctionalInterface annotation.

But the Java 8 API is also full of new functional interfaces to make your life easier.
Some of those new interfaces are well known from the Google Guava library.
Even if you're familiar with this library you should keep a close eye on how those interfaces are extended
by some useful method extensions.
