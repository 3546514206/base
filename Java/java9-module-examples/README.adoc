= Java 9 Module Examples

What I have learned from the Resources list is that Module System in Java 9 is an optional decision. Your project could rely on the classpath as before whereas the module system brings several benefits to your applications such as modular thinking, encapsulation, dependency management and services. To this end, in this repository you'll find several practical Java 9 module examples that could give you some brief ideas. Feel free to open up https://github.com/ozlerhakan/java9-module-examples/issues/new[an issue], if you find any typos or mistakes that I have made.  

=== Modi

Shows how to compile and run an unnamed module.

=== ModiM

Demonstrates how to compile and run an application module.

=== ModiMs-exports-requires

Demonstrates how to compile and run multiple application modules using the `exports` and `requires` clauses.

=== ModiMs-provides-uses

Demonstrates how to compile and run multiple application modules using the `provides ... with` and `uses` clauses.

=== ReT (Requires-Transitive)

Shows the way of handling transitive dependencies on a module system.

=== Javafx

Shows how to solve the issues while converting a javafx project into an application module.
