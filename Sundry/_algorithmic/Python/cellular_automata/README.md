# Cellular Automata

Cellular automata are a way to simulate the behavior of "life", no matter if it is a robot or cell.
They usually follow simple rules but can lead to the creation of complex forms.
The most popular cellular automaton is Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
