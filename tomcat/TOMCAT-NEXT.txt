Notes of things to consider for the next major Tomcat release (9.0.x)

 1. Fix Java 8 Javadoc warnings. Currently ~2650.

 2. DONE.
    Remove BIO AJP and HTTP connector.

 3. DONE.
    Remove Comet support.

 4. DONE.
    Refactor the connectors to minimise code duplication.
    - All implementation specific per connector code -> Endpoint
    - All implementation specific per connection code -> SocketWrapper

 5. DONE
    SNI support for JSSE.

 6. See what Java 8 language features we want to use.

 7. Connector refactoring required for HTTP/2 APIs that might be exposed in
    the Servlet API.

 8. Keep an eye on the other Java EE 8 EGs (no sign of any movement apart
    from the Servlet EG so far).

 9. DONE
    Refactor WebSocket I/O to go directly to Tomcat's internals rather than via
    the Servlet API.

10. Remove the use of system properties to control configuration wherever
    possible.

11. Reduce instances of setters and getters for the same property existing on an
    object and its parent. This may require new objects to be exposed via JMX.

12. Consider wrapping the SocketWrapper with a facade to detect / prevent
    components retaining references longer than they should.
